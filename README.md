# fBE_axion-lepton

This repository contains the supplementary software and data for the article "Precise predictions for the QCD axion contribution to dark radiation with full phase-space evolution" published in [JHEP02(2025)108](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP02(2025)108) (arxiv: [2410.18186](https://arxiv.org//abs/2410.18186)). 

The software includes the MATLAB codes for the solution of number density Boltzmann equations (nBE) and full phase-space Boltzmann equations (fBE) for axions produced by non-diagonal lepton decays and diagonal lepton scatterings, computation of ∆Neff, generating figures for the comoving number density evolution and projections of phase-space density at different x, as well as generating movies of phase-space density evolution. The supplement data includes the results for ∆Neff vs. f/C computed with different approaches for tau decays and diagonal processes with muons and tau leptons (the data is also accompanied with the MATLAB scripts for generating the plots from the article). 

See the README files in the corresponding directories for more details.
