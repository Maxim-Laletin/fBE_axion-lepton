The code to solve the number density Boltzmann equation (nBE) and the full phase-space Boltzmann equation (fBE) for axions produced by tau lepton decays. 

The number of effective density and entropy degrees of freedom are approximated by cubic splines constructed from the data in [1606.07494](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07494). The code also computes âˆ†Neff, generates the types of plots that correspond to Figs. 3 and 4 in [2410.18186](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18186) and contains a commented part that generates a movie that depicts the evolution of the distribution functions.
