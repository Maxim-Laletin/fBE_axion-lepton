The code to solve the number density Boltzmann equation (nBE) and the full phase-space Boltzmann equation (fBE) for axions produced by flavour-diagonal scattering processes with leptons (annihilation + Primakoff scattering). 

The number of effective density and entropy degrees of freedom are approximated by cubic splines constructed from the data in [1606.07494](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07494). The user has two options to provide the collision term for the fBE: 1) use a simplified approach which assumes that all the particles have Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions; 2) interpolate the collision term from the tabulated values computed with the [CollCalc](https://github.com/Maxim-Laletin/CollCalc) package in full generality. The code also computes âˆ†Neff, generates the types of plots that correspond to Figs. 6 and 7 in [2410.18186](https://arxiv.org//abs/2410.18186) and contains a commented part that generates a movie that depicts the evolution of the distribution functions.
